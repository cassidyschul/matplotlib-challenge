I developed a python script to analyze and visualize a pharmaceutical company's animal dataset for anti-cancer medications. 

A bar plot was created to show the number of observed mouse timespoints for each drug regimen.

A pie chart was created to show the sex distribution in mice used for this study.

A box plot was developed to show to distribution of tumor volume for for different drugs (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin).

A mouse treated with Capomulin was selected and a line plot was generated to plot the tumor volume versus the time.

A scatter plot was created and linear regression analysis was performed between the mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. The correlation is 0.84, therefore there is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
